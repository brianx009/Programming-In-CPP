\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The memory management of raw pointers is manual, and the developer is responsible for allocating and freeing memory.
\item This makes working with raw pointers prone to memory leaks and other bugs.
\item In modern C++, you rarely work with raw pointers directly and instead work with smart pointers, which take care of the dynamic memory management for you.
\item If using smart pointers there is no reason to be using "{}\+New"{} or "{}\+Delete"{}.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Are used to manage memory allocate on the free store and in more ways act exactly as a raw pointer does.
\item Smart pointers are allocated on the Stack, and you do not need to call delete or delete\mbox{[}\mbox{]} to free up memory.
\item Errors such as multiple deallocations, memory leaks, and allocation/ deallocation mismatches can be eliminated.
\item Uses a technique known as "{}\+Resource Acquistion Is Initialization"{} (RAII).

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item C++ technique that bings the life cycle of a resource that must be acquired to the lifetime of an object.
\item You instantiate and manage the lfetime of an object on the stack.
\item The object on the stack takes tcare of managing your dynamically allocated resources.
\item Smart pointers are defined templates in the memory header of the C++ Standard Library. (This means this is a built in part of the C++ language)

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item behaves like a pointer to a type T and is unique -- only one pointer containing the memory address can exist.
\item A unique pointer exclusively own whatever it points to.
\item There can only be one unique pointer pointing to a certain memory address at any point.
\item A unique pointer cannot be copied since the compiler will not allow this.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item behaves like a pointer to a type T -- there can be any number of shared pointers for the same resource.
\item Difference between a shared pointer and a unique pointer is that with a shared pointer there can be any number of shared pointers pointing to the same underlying resource. -- the shared pointer implemention is smart enough to figure out that the underlying resource should not be cleaned up as long as there is at least 1 shared pointer pointing to it.
\item How does it know that there is even 1 shared pointer left ? -- because of something known as the resource counting.
\item Every shared pointer keeps track of the nuber of "{}strong"{} and "{}weak"{} references to the underlying memory.
\item Strong references are incrememnted each time a new shared pointer references the same memory, such as when a pointer is copied.
\item Strong references are decrememnted each time a shared pointer releases memory or goes out of scope. -- underlying memory is only freed when the number of strong references reaches zero.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item is linked to a shared\+\_\+ptr$<$\+T$>$ and points to the same resource -- it does not increment the reference count.
\item weak\+\_\+ptr can not have an independent existance.
\item shared\+\_\+ptr sets a strong reference count, but because weak\+\_\+ptr does not incrememnt the reference count, this means that we can deallocate/ clean up our references although there are some weak\+\_\+ptr\textquotesingle{}s that exist.
\item Weak pointers exist and are used to mitigate circular references, which cause memory leaks.
